# deemix-docker

Deemix in a Docker container.

## How to run this

Deemix will work out of the box, but you should at least set a fixed port for the web interface and mount a folder to the container for where your downloads will go.

You can also map a folder on the host for the config file (mount a local folder to /config/), but that's optional. If they add or rework settings in the future, there is no guarantee that your old configs will work, so beware.

### Example for Docker:
```
$ docker run -d --name Deemix \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/downloads \
              -v /your/config/location:/config \
              -e PUID=1000 \
              -e PGID=1000 \
              -e ARL=1234567 \
              -p 9666:9666 \
              bocki/deemix
```

### Example for Docker Compose:
```
version: '3.3'
services:
    deemix:
	    image: bocki/deemix
        container_name: Deemix
        volumes:
            - /your/storage/path/:/downloads
            - /your/config/location:/config
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - ARL=1234567
        ports:
            - 9666:9666
```

### Updating Deemix

The container will look for a new update in the Deemix repo on every start and will update itself. So if you want to update Deemix, just stop and start the Container. Also works with docker-compose stop.

### Explanation:

`-v /your/storage/path/:/downloads`     - Path for your music downloads.

`-v /your/config/location:/config`      - OPTIONAL: Path to your local configuration.

`-e PUID=1000`                          - OPTIONAL: User ID of the user you want the container to run as in order to fix folder permission issues.

`-e PGID=1000`                          - OPTIONAL: Group ID, see above.

`-e ARL=1234567`                        - OPTIONAL: If you want Deemix to automatically log in for everyone who opens the website, provide your ARL token via this Environment variable.

`-p 9666:9666`                          - Port opened for the web interface.

`bocki/deemix`                          - This container.

To access the web interface, go to http://YOURSERVERIP:9666
